## CVE-2025-6965 (CRITICAL) in `libsqlite3-0`

**Vulnerability Mitigation: CVE-2025-6965**
==================================================

### Recommendation:

Upgrade `libsqlite3-0` package to version **3.50.2 or above** to mitigate this critical vulnerability.

### Reasoning:

The vulnerability exists in SQLite versions before 3.50.2, which can lead to a memory corruption issue due to excessive aggregate terms exceeding the number of columns available. Upgrading to a supported version (3.50.2 or later) will ensure that this issue is resolved and your system remains secure.

### Notes:

* No patching or mitigation is recommended for installed versions prior to 3.40.1-2+deb12u1, as they are not affected by this vulnerability.
* Always verify the package version and compatibility with your system before applying any updates or upgrades.
* Consult relevant documentation or security advisories for more information on the upgrade process and potential dependencies.
